## About

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is designed to enhance road safety by using machine learning to alert drivers when they show signs of drowsiness or distraction. It is developed using Keras, a deep learning framework, and integrates with an in-car camera to continuously monitor the driver's condition during a trip. It is designed to promote road safety, reduce accidents caused by drowsy driving, and protect the well-being of both drivers and passengers. It adheres to privacy and ethical guidelines and aims to provide a non-invasive solution to alert drivers effectively.

## About the dataset
The dataset used is Drowsiness Dataset (link) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset. It has images labelled for the status of facial expressions like, open and close for eyes and yawn and no yawn for yawning. Four folders in total are available for the same.

Total no. of images: 2900

Images used for training: 1377
